Welcome to the Re-Align Workshop Hackathon! This challenge focuses on understanding and comparing representational alignment across a wide variety of vision models. Join either the 🟦 Blue Team or 🟥 Red Team and compete to discover whether representations are **universal** or **idiosyncratic**.

## 📚 Research Context

Representational alignment has emerged as both an implicit and explicit goal in many machine learning subfields, including knowledge distillation ([Hinton et al., 2015]()), disentanglement ([Montero et al., 2022]()), and concept-based models ([Koh et al., 2020]()).
The concept has been explored under various terms including latent space alignment, conceptual alignment, and representational similarity analysis ([Kriegeskorte et al., 2008](); [Peterson et al., 2018](); [Roads & Love, 2020](); [Muttenthaler et al., 2023]()).

Recent work has leveraged human perceptual judgments to enrich representations within vision models ([Sundaram et al., 2024]()), while other research explores using brain signals to fine-tune semantic representations in language models. However, there remains little consensus on which metrics best identify similarity between systems ([Harvey et al., 2024](); [Schaeffer et al., 2024]()).

Representational alignment can help machines learn useful representations from humans with less supervision ([Fel et al., 2022](); [Muttenthaler et al., 2023](); [Sucholutsky & Griffiths, 2023]()), while also uncovering opportunities for humans to leverage domain-specific representations from machines when designing hybrid systems ([Steyvers et al., 2022](); [Shin et al., 2023](); [Schut et al., 2023]()).

## 🏁 Quickstart

1. **Choose your team**: [🟦 Blue (universality)](#-blue-team) or [🟥 Red (idiosyncracy)](#-red-team).
2. **Fork the repository** following our [setup instructions](#-getting-started).
3. **Explore the example notebooks** in our [starter code section](#-getting-started).
4. **Submit your findings** using our [submission process](#-submission-process).

Good luck! 🍀

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

We have **~1300 vision models** available, complete with metadata about architecture, training data, and more. This hackathon seeks to answer fundamental questions that have driven recent research in representational alignment ([Sucholutsky et al., 2023](); [Muttenthaler et al., 2024]()). Participants will join either a 🟦 Blue Team or a 🟥 Red Team, and provide JSON submissions that demonstrate the largest uniform set of models (Blue) or greatest differentiation among those models (Red).

### 🟦 Blue Team

_"Finding unexpected similarities."_
Building on work showing that different networks can learn similar representations at scale, Blue Teams search for cases where this convergence occurs.

- **🎯 Objective**: Submit a collection of models demonstrating representational and/or functional equivalence.
- **💡 Challenge**: Discover similarities among different architectures.
- **🏅 Victory condition**: Largest uniform set of representationally and/or functionally identical models.

### 🟥 Red Team

_"Prompting idiosyncratic distinctions."_
Following approaches that examine models presumed to be aligned to uncover representational differences, Red Teams develop stimuli that drive misalignment in model representations.

- **🎯 Objective**: Curate stimuli that reveal representational and/or functional differences.
- **💡 Challenge**: Identify the most informative test cases highlighting variation.
- **🏅 Victory condition**: Greatest differentiation among model representations and/or behaviors.
